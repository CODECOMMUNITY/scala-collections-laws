// This file contains lists of flags to ignore based on Scala version.
//
// Version string goes on the left.  Then an arrow, then the flags to disable on the right.
// If the version is not an exact match
//    * The mapping with the longest initial match wins
//    * If there is still a tie, the shortest version string here wins
// Thus, if Scala 2.11.3 is used and this file has only 2.11.2 and 2.11 mappings,
// 2.11 will win because although both match the initial 4 characters, "2.11" is
// shorter than "2.11.2".
//
// It may seem strange to only disable flags instead of being able to add them.  There is
// a good reason: a flag goes on both a collection _and_ a source line, which enables
// or disables the test line for exactly that collection.  Adding flags is problematic
// because you'd need to specify which collection(s) needed the flags.  If flags are always
// removed based on Scala version, you can define good or problematic pairs in the single-line
// and replacements file, and then knock out that pairing by referring to the flag here.
//
// For instance, if a test fails on 2.11.0, you could add
//    2.11.0 -->
// here, mark the problematic pair with BUG2110 on the collection and !BUG2110 on the
// test, then add BUG2110 to every _other_ version string in this file.

2.11.2 -->
2.11   --> TWOELEVENTWO
2.12   --> TWOELEVENTWO
